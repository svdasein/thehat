TheHat
======

TheHat is a Ruby based workflow task coordination system.  You can use it
to coordinate things like release cycles,
deployment procedures, and pretty much anything where you have
to make a bunch of things happen in a particular order.  

TheHat aims at a very precise niche in the "workflow" world - precise enough
that it "workflow" applies only in the most generic sense of the word: Its
goal is primarily to drive a predefined directed graph of tasks 
through to completion by tracking and prompting work by teams of
people and/or automated systems in near real time.

You can use TheHat to drive teams and processes through things like:

* Complex Methods of Procedure (MOPs) including
 * Software upgrades
 * Network reconfigurations
 * Configuration changes
 * etc
* Long running "procedures" like
 * Software development cycles
 * Billing cycles
 * Technical sales procedures

Procedures codified as TheHat workflows become active entities - running programs.
In a sense your procedures manage themselves.  It can alleviate quite a lot of
procedural drudgery and potential for mishaps that drudgery can lead to.
