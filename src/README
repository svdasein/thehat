TheHat is a library and a collection of frontends to that library that act as 
an interactive workflow engine. Its user interface is command line-ish.  In 
operation, a TheHat instance guides a "conversation" between workflow 
particpants and itself, prompting workflow activities in whatever 
communication medium(s) you happen to be using.  TheHat has a number of 
rendering modules that give various views of the progress of a given workflow.  
The output from these renderers is available from a web page that the engine 
generates automatically.

This distribution comes with three frontends:

thehat-tty: This is just you and the engine - no clocks, no network, no nuthin. 
It's useful for learning, authoring, debugging, etc.

thehat-irc: This logs onto an IRC server and joins a channel.  It includes 
automatic clock processing, etc and is an example of the way that group 
coordination can be done.

thehat-xmpp: This logs onto an xmpp (jabber server) and connects to a MUC (multi-
user chat).  It includes automatic clock processing.
