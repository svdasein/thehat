I understand the following commands.

addsequence addstep checkout clockProcessing commit date time debug delstep dryrun dump exec fail finish gimmeall gimmegroup gimme givegroupto giveto help idleprompt list load ls new notificationProcessing reload restore reverted reverting run save set start status stop sysstatus tictoc unload

Using the set command, you can alter the following workflow step properties: name owner description startCommand notifyAtStart finishCommand notifyAtFinish group url note gates

There are also a few special "properties" that deal with gates and group membership: addgate delgate addgroup delgroup gate groups

The following clock-owner types are available: wait alarm handoff event stopwatch

Clock-type owner names take the form "clock-<type>:m/d/y@h:m:s"
